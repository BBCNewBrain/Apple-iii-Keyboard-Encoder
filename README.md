# Apple-iii
Apple iii Arduino code

I started this from some Apple ii code, but can;t find it now so please let me know if it was you. :-) 

The code is still not 100% tested as I need to fix my Apple /// memory before testing further.
It has code to type in the ADTPro code for serial coms if you press the char 55.

Please comment, improve and feedback. :-)
